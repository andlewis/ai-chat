# AiChat
This project is an Angular 19 front-end for Azure OpenAI resources. You will need to provide your own API keys.

[Sample Deployment](https://delightful-bay-0171c1510.5.azurestaticapps.net)

## Getting Started
Grab the code and install the packages `npm -i`, then run it with `ng s`

## Why?
This app is a proof of concept, and an exercise in developing a client that has no backend. Nothing is stored of your conversations, other than in your browser local storage. That means clearing your browser history will clear the conversation history as well.
